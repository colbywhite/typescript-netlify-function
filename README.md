# typescript-netlify-function-template by [Colby M. White]

This is my preferred starting template for a vanilla netlify function with typescript
with what I consider a sane set of starting settings.

It contains the following:
- Basic Hello, World function response
- Sane npm scripts
- `dotenv` support
